     <h2>Ballet</h2>
     <p>
       I have been passionate about classical dance since I was 5 years old.
       Classical dance represents for me the beauty of the body, the search for perfection, grace, elegance, accuracy and rigor. The whole difficulty of this sport, which is above all an art, is to give the impression to the spectators that everything is infinitely easy and light. The sets, the costumes, the orchestra ... all the more help us to immerse ourselves in this universe so far away.

       If you want to escape in this parallel world, I let you admire the  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfmSv0z205s"target="_blank">Coda from the Black Swan pas de deux in Act III</a>

     <h2>Fashion</h2>
     <p>
       Haute couture. When we hear this word, we often think of surrealist clothes ... But in reality, when we ask ourselves more about this area, haute couture and ready-to-wear are above all an art. The art of assembling materials, colors. Each season, the artistic directors demonstrate flawless creativity and originality while keeping the DNA of their brand. I find it fascinating, watching the evolution of a haute couture house over time.

       During the last fashion week in Paris (September - October 2021), one of the shows that struck me the most was that of <a href="https://www.versace.com/fr/fr-fr/world-of-versace/stories/defiles/ss-2022-men-women.html"> Versace</a>. The collection showcased beautiful colors, the overlays of fabrics / pieces were very well mastered as well as the fittings and the making. Donatella Versace really succeeded in taking us into her world, especially thanks to the sets and music.

     <h2>Geopolitics</h2>
     <p>
       Geopolitics could be defined as a human science that studies politics and international relations based on geographic and historical facts.
       This science deals with international news by taking into account different actors. It allows us to better understand the world of today and tomorrow as well as these issues.
     </p>
     <p>
       Moreover, geopolitics is everywhere! It punctuates our daily lives without even realizing it! At the base of geopolitics, there are two fundamental notions: hard power (is deployed in the form of coercion: using force, the threat of force, economic sanctions, or inducements of payment) and soft power (In contrast to the coercive nature of hard power, soft power describes the use of positive attraction and persuasion to achieve foreign policy objectives.). I let you discover an <a href="https://www.iris-france.org/161949-squid-game-parasite-k-pop-le-soft-power-sud-coreen-a-son-apogee/">example of soft power</a> omnipresent in our daily life ...

     <h2>Trips</h2>
     <p>
       We are fortunate to be able to travel to discover new horizons, new cultures and new traditions. In my opinion, it is essential to be open to the world, open to others. We must not be content with our country but get out of our comfort zone. In addition, this type of experience allows us to evolve, grow and become more mature.
     </p>
     <p>
       So which part of the globe would you like to visit? do you have any desires? <a href="https://youtu.be/IB0b6paBWCA">South America</a> might be a good idea for a destination: a trip full of surprises.

     <h2>Art</h2>
     <p>
       It's very difficult to define what"art" is because it's something personal, nobody loves the same things, feels the same emotions... But some dictionnary agree to give this definition "art is the various branches of creative activity, such as painting, music, literature, and dance". Art, allows you to be cultivated. It deals with your own sensitivities and your curiosity.

       For instance, the last exhibition I saw was the <a href="https://www.fondationlouisvuitton.fr/fr/evenements/icones-de-l-art-moderne-la-collection-morozov">Mozorov collection at the Louis Vuitton foundation</a> . In addition to being an architectural masterpiece, this building houses paintings and status of great artists (Picasso ...)
